# snippets
This repo is a general code dump for snippets, tools, one-off scripts developed within Nictiz. The code in this repo should not be regarded production ready; instead this repo is meant to easily store and share code written so that it might be of use to others (when it turns out to be useful in a broader context, it can be developed further and will usually be moved to another repo).

## Adding code
If you have something to add to this repo, please do so in the following way:
* Put everything needed in a new folder on the root level.
* Add to this folder a README.md file, containing _at least_ a brief description of the code (more is better of course).
